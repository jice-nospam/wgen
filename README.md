# WGEN - a simple heightmap generator

There are a lot of great terrain generators out there but most of them have a free version with a terrain size limitation.

This is a much simpler generator, but it can export maps as big as you want.

Continent example, using a rough hill pattern and a high frequency FBM :

Island example, using mid-point deplacement algorithm :

Smoother landscape using only hills generator :

Exemple of (untextured) 4K x 4K landscape imported in Unreal Engine 5 :

# Manual
## Generators
This is where you control the world generation. You can stack several "generators" that applies some modification to the heightmap.
Select the generator with the dropdown button, then press `New step` button to add it to the stack.
You can click on a step label in the stack to select it and display its parameters. Click the `Refresh` button once you changed the parameters values to recompute the heightmap from this step.

The current version features those generators :
- Hills : superposition of hemispheric hills to generate a smooth terrain
- Fbm : fractal brownian motion can be used to add noise to an existing terrain or as first step to generate a continent-like terrain.
- MidPoint : square-diamond mid-point deplacement generates a realistic looking heightmap
- Normalize : scales the heightmap back to the range 0.0..1.0. Some generators work better with a normalized heightmap. Check your heightmap values range in the 2D preview.
- LandMass : scale the terrain so that a defined proportion is above a defined water level. Also applies a x^3 curve above water level to have a nice plain/mountain ratio
- MudSlide : smoothen the terrain by simulating earth sliding along slopes
- WaterErosion : carves rivers by simulating rain drops dragging earth along slopes
- Island : lower the altitude along the borders of the map

## Masks
You can add a mask to a generator step by clicking the square next to the generator name.
You can then edit the mask using a painting brush. The generator effect will be scaled depending on the mask color.

## Terrain preview
You have a 2D preview displaying the heightmap (at current selected step in the generators UI). You can change the preview heightmap size from 64x64 for very fast computation to 512x512 for a more precise visualization. If `live preview` button is checked, the 2D preview will be updated at every step during computation.

You also have a 3D preview displaying the final 3D mesh. The mesh uses the same resolution as the 2D preview.
You can change the view by dragging the mouse cursor in the view :
- rotate the terrain with left button
- zoom with middle button
- pan with right button

You can also display a water plane with configurable height and a grid to help visualize the terrain.

## Save/Load project
Here you can save the current generator configuration (all the steps with their parameters) in a plain text file using RON format. You can also load a previously saved project, erasing the current configuration.

## Exporter
You can export the resulting heightmap as a single PNG file or several tiled files using this panel.

File names will be generated using _x?_y? pattern, for example for 2x2 tiles :
* ..._x0_y0.png
* ..._x1_y0.png
* ..._x0_y1.png
* ..._x1_y1.png
